# Austin Paul — Portfolio (Jekyll)

What I need to replace before publishing:

- Email: update the placeholder in `index.md` from `your-email@example.com` to your real email.
- GitHub: update the placeholder link in `index.md` from `https://github.com/your-github-username` to your profile.
- Profile image: replace `assets/me_canyon.jpg` with your own headshot (keep the same filename and path).
- CV: replace `cv.pdf` with your current CV (keep the same filename). The existing `cv.html` and `cv.pdf` are left unchanged from the original; swap in your own PDF when ready.

Notes
- Theme, layouts, Sass/CSS, and assets structure are unchanged to preserve the original UI/responsiveness.
- `_config.yml` has updated `title` and `description`. Do not change other fields unless needed.
- `_data/papers.yml` was cleared to a placeholder. Add your own entries later (or leave empty).
